# Welcome to RSGLBT

This is an alternative index for invisible orientations unrelated to LGBT and its woke undercurrent. Woketivism has created a lot of myths about LGBT issues, and this index seeks to clarify things. As one example, one can be either a straight robosexual / sanguephiliac or a gay one. And you can also be a transexual one. This doesnt make sense if robosexuality or sanguaphiliac were classified as orientations or genders.

Therefore this keeps the Robosexuality index in its purest form, unadulterated by post modernism.
