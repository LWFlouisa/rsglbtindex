UPLOADED FAIRY

Art Style: This is drawn on a four panel grid, using a mixture of Sumi Painting and Charcoal. Because of the grid, I’m not sure how 5 panel pages will translate. Visually, it blends the French graphic novel tradition of Bande Dessinnee ( specifically Western ) and Seinen Manga of a Horror Scifi bent.

Plot: This is a Horror / Scifi Romance that crosses the time periods of the 1830s to 2129 A.D. In the 1800s, France recovers from the aftermath of the first French Revolution. However the main focus revolution is in the one of 1871. In the future, mankind blurs that distinction between Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and Humanity in a period of Modern Stasis.

Historical Context: Paris is recovering from the aftermath of the 1871 Revolution. In the future, the US is split between Japanese and French imperial powers for control over the hallowed land mass that was once the United States.

THE SCENERY WAS A WIRE MESH OF FANTASY NATURALISM: THE ONLY MOVEMENT LUCID FLUIDITY, THE CREATURES FLITTED ABOUT LIKE DEAD BUTTERFLY WINGS. A WORLD OF PURPLE MATRIX SNOW. THE VILLAGE WAS REMINISCENT OF SOME OF THE FANTASY VILLAGES FOUND IN DIFFERENT TROPE SPECIFIC SIMULATIONS, EXCEPT THE STRAW THAT MADE THE HOUSES WERE WIRE FRAMED AND TRANSLUCENT. A SIMULATION OF A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE.

CAPTION: Nadine, Malcolm, and Nadine restart the game of Voreth’s Promise.

NADINE: Can you imagine yourself trying to live in one of these? RASSIE: I wouldn’t even be in this simulation, without your morse trans-coder. MALCOLM: I’ve played it, no doubt. But while my lasted, it manifested very differently.

DIALOGUE CONTINUATION.

NADINE: How so? MALCOLM: My forests were lushly green, and other things you might label to be utopic. NADINE: Sounds boring. MALCOLM: Yes, but it’s good boring to you. I can even converse with Bianca after she left this world.

MILLIE: You can’t be serious Elena, and Aldiel is in on this too? ELENA: Well you want to eat better food right, and not have peasants flirt with you. MILLIE: Well that’s true, but doesn’t that mean I have to suck the dick of anyone that rescues me from my execution?

ELENA GENTLY BRUSHES AWAY MILLIE’S TEARS.

ELENA: Well who said you were going to be executed anyway. I know the death of our parents was hard on you, it was also hard on me as well.

ELENA POINTS TO THE SKY, IMPLYING THE CASTLE CITY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND NATION.

LIVING ROOM AREA - THEY ARE SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM. MILLIE IS PARALYZED. NADINE IS ALOOF, WHILE SMOKING A JOINT.

NADINE IS FACING IN MALCOLM’S DIRECTION.

NADINE: Say Malcolm. MALCOLM: Yea, what’s of Nadine. NADINE: That’s one hell of a smart chat bot isn’t it? MALCOLM: I know right!

RASSIE HUGS AND COMFORTS MILLIE. RASSIE IS UNAWARE HER PROSTHETIC EYE IS RECORDING THE CONVERSATION FOR THE DREAM-SCANNERS.

ELENA: Don’t you think something seems a little off about them? I don’t mean in the “hero” sense, but … well you tell him Millie.

MILLIE: I feel like I’ve met the red haired girl before, … I can’t recognize that tomboy appearance before. It feels as if I died once before, and she’s there to greet me on the other side.

ALDIEL: You musn’t think to much about it. The important thing is Dantino’s army will arrive here in the morning.

NADINE’S ROOM.

MALCOLM: I didn’t know there was that side of you Nadine. I mean, in all the years I’ve lived in the slums.

NADINE: Well would you talk about your fetishes to people?

MALCOLM: I get it, but you also used your fetish to get us stuck inside this game world.

RASSIE: The point is, if we want to return home, we need to protect Millie.

PAGE NINETY FOUR

YET NOW NADINE WAKES UP SCREAMING.

NADINE: Hey Rassie, are we really stuck here? RASSIE: Should have thought of that before letting Millie die the first time you played. MALCOLM: What happened, I heard a yell. NADINE: Da rien.

NADINE, TALKING WITH MILLIE IN HER DREAM:

NADINE ( tht ) I had originally hated you. You represented everything about princesses I despised. Everything in cis gendered women. Those luscious lips. That beautiful smile. The illusion of childish innocence. I need to return home.
